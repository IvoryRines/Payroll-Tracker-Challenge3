# payroll-tracker-challenge3

This is an application for tracking employee payroll. I was provided with starter code. It was my job to create functionality that would allow a user to enter name and salary data for one or more employees. The application is now funtioning, allowing for the input and display of data, as well as the functionality to calculate the average salary of employees added to the form. It is also able to select a random employee from the index of names created by the user inputs.

This is screenshot of my finished Employee Payroll Tracker:
